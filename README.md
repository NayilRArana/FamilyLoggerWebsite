# FamilyLoggerWebsite

This is a hosting web app that allows a user to register, login, and download a simple console application that logs keys typed while it is open. The web app part is what's in this repo. This is a side project I made to acquaint myself with the Microsoft stack.

## Highlights

There are a few things I'd like to bring to the reader's attention:

* This was made using the default Bootstrap template provided by visual studio for the front-end. I wrote a small amount of HTML with some Bootstrap elements myself, but none of the CSS and JavaScript in this project was written by me. This project made with the intention of learning some C#, ASP.NET, and SQL Server.
* The code I'm most proud of is in Login.aspx, Login.aspx.cs, Registration.aspx, Registration.aspx.cs, Site.Master, and Site.Master.cs.
