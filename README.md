# FamilyLoggerWebsite

This is a web app that allows a user to register, login, and download a simple console application that logs keys typed while it is open. The web app part is what's in this repo. This is a side project I made to acquaint myself with the Microsoft stack.

## Getting Started

The site was formerly hosted on the cloud with Microsoft Azure, but my free trial ran out. I might deploy it somewhere else later.

## Highlights

There are a few things I'd like to bring to the reader's attention:

* This was made using the Bootstrap library for HTML/CSS/Javascript on the front-end; and C#, ASP.NET, and SQL Server on the backend.
* The code I'm most proud of is in Login.aspx, Login.aspx.cs, Registration.aspx, Registration.aspx.cs, Site.Master, and Site.Master.cs.


## Built With

* C#
* ASP.NET
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Bootstrap
* Deployed to the cloud with Microsoft Azure

## Acknowledgments

* StackOverflow
